# Chat GPT Prompts for the Activities
The following prompts were created as example for the content-first activities at the workshop. 

## 1. Prime the AI with Jacob's persona.
```
I am creating a prototype for a fictitious job search engine to showcase the accessibility and user requirements for a candidate like Jacob. 
In this prototype, I will start by creating the priority guides using a content-first methodology. can you help me with the content? 
Here's a persona profile of a user I'd like to user as a reference for making sure the solution is accessible:

Jacob, Blind, a bit of a geek
"The right technology lets me do anything."

Overview on Jacob
- Jacob is a paralegal in a large law firm. He reviews cases and writes summaries, cross-referencing them to the firm’s own cases and clients. He’s building expertise in his area of law and is hoping to go to law school in a year or so.
- As far as Jacob is concerned, it’s the technology that’s handicapped, not him. When everything is in place, he can work just as fast and just as effectively as anyone in his office.
- He’s a bit of a gadget geek, always trying out new tools, looking for a little edge and something new. The last few years have been a lot of fun with all the new apps, and VoiceOver on his Mac and phone lets him use most of them pretty well. He likes the challenge of learning new tools.
- His other challenge is running. He’s training for a 10K run, running with a club in his neighborhood and using an app to plan his routes and track his distance.
- He’s just started to use The iPhone app, Passbook, and uses it to get train tickets and other travel. The regional rail system has an app, so he can just pull up the barcode and scan it at the ticket office. No fumbling for the right printed card—total independence. Same phone as everyone. Same app as everyone, and it all just works.

## 2. Create User Journey Map

```
Create a user journey map outlining the steps Jacob might take when using the job search engine from searching for jobs, reviewing job descriptions, and applying for a job. This journey map should take into consideration the persona profile of Jacob, emphasizing the accessibility and user-friendly features of the platform. For each step of the journey create a headline and a description.
