## Abstract
- Access to data is crucial in today's digital age, but almost one in four adults in the US faces barriers due to disabilities, especially when accessing Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) data. At the Rhonda Weiss Center for Accessible IDEA data, our goal is to improve equity by promoting accessibility beyond minimum compliance.
- In our workshop, “How to Create Accessible Experiences That Inspire," we emphasize a content-first approach to accessible design. We explore how digital content unintentionally creates barriers and how understanding the needs of users of assistive technology can help us avoid those pitfalls.
- We introduce rapid prototyping, a method to quickly develop and test accessible solutions. Through hands-on exercises, we guide you in creating functional and inclusive prototypes.
- Collecting early and frequent feedback is key. We demonstrate involving people with disabilities in evaluating early concepts, ensuring their needs are considered throughout the design process. Don't worry about coding skills; our workshop is accessible to all. Bring your
- Windows or Mac laptop and a willingness to learn.
- Together, we'll dive into accessible digital design, striving to create a world where everyone can participate fully and independently. Join us in shaping a more inclusive digital future.

## Key points
- “Nothing about us without us” – Be inclusive.
- Inclusive design enriches user experience for all, not just those with disabilities.
- Early user testing with diverse groups eliminates costly redesigns.
- Designing with words (i.e., real content) empowers content creators to prioritize accessibility from the outset.
